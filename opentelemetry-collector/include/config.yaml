# Default OpenTelemetry Collector config for ap-opentelemetry-collector.
# OTLP in (gRPC/HTTP) → batch → debug. Override at runtime by mounting your own config or setting OTEL_CONFIG.
# For StatsD + Airflow metric mappings (equivalent to statsd-exporter mappings-gen2), use config-gen2.yaml instead.
# See: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/
