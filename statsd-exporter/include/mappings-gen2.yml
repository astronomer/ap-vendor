# For metrics with labels: {},
# Airflow-instance-specific information like dag_id and task_id
# are omitted to preserve low cardinality in the metrics.
# The only label will be the Airflow deployment name,

# in the case of users with many Airflow instances being monitored

  # As of version 0.7.0, we deploy an image that exposes this metric
  # as a counter instead of a gauge. (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4027).
  # As a result we need to account for this as we transition already running
  # deployments to the latest docker image. This additional label lets us fix up our alerts and dashboards.
